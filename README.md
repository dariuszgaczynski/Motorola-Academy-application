I have started to learn Java, because I wanted to gain new skills that are prospective and would open me the doors to new opportunities.
I am a person that likes different challenges and this is one of them. I also have many ideas on how to help others and make world a better and easier place to live.
Appropriate coding skills will alow me to make those ideas come to life.
